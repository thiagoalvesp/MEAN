## Install

```sh
$ npm install on-finished
```

## API

```js
var onFinished = require('on-finished')
```

### onFinished(res, listener)

Attach a listener to listen for the response to finish. The listener will
be invoked only once when the response finished. If the response finished
<<<<<<< HEAD
to an error, the first argument will contain the error. If the response
has already finished, the listener will be invoked.
=======
to to an error, the first argument will contain the error.
>>>>>>> 4aed1c6aeb51175eed9a48aad02c74f113b1c349

Listening to the end of a response would be used to close things associated
with the response, like open files.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Listener is invoked as `listener(err, res)`.

```js
onFinished(res, function (err, res) {
  // clean up open fds, etc.
  // err contains the error is request error'd
=======
```js
onFinished(res, function (err) {
  // clean up open fds, etc.
>>>>>>> 4aed1c6aeb51175eed9a48aad02c74f113b1c349
})
```

### onFinished(req, listener)

Attach a listener to listen for the request to finish. The listener will
be invoked only once when the request finished. If the request finished
<<<<<<< HEAD
to an error, the first argument will contain the error. If the request
has already finished, the listener will be invoked.
=======
to to an error, the first argument will contain the error.
>>>>>>> 4aed1c6aeb51175eed9a48aad02c74f113b1c349

Listening to the end of a request would be used to know when to continue
after reading the data.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Listener is invoked as `listener(err, req)`.

=======
>>>>>>> 4aed1c6aeb51175eed9a48aad02c74f113b1c349
```js
var data = ''

req.setEncoding('utf8')
res.on('data', function (str) {
  data += str
})

<<<<<<< HEAD
onFinished(req, function (err, req) {
=======
onFinished(req, function (err) {
>>>>>>> 4aed1c6aeb51175eed9a48aad02c74f113b1c349
  // data is read unless there is err
})
```

### onFinished.isFinished(res)

Determine if `res` is already finished. This would be useful to check and
not even start certain operations if the response has already finished.

### onFinished.isFinished(req)

Determine if `req` is already finished. This would be useful to check and
not even start certain operations if the request has already finished.

## Special Node.js requests

### HTTP CONNECT method

The meaning of the `CONNECT` method from RFC 7231, section 4.3.6:

> The CONNECT method requests that the recipient establish a tunnel to
> the destination origin server identified by the request-target and,
> if successful, thereafter restrict its behavior to blind forwarding
> of packets, in both directions, until the tunnel is closed.  Tunnels
> are commonly used to create an end-to-end virtual connection, through
> one or more proxies, which can then be secured using TLS (Transport
> Layer Security, [RFC5246]).

In Node.js, these request objects come from the `'connect'` event on
the HTTP server.

When this module is used on a HTTP `CONNECT` request, the request is
considered "finished" immediately, **due to limitations in the Node.js
interface**. This means if the `CONNECT` request contains a request entity,
the request will be considered "finished" even before it has been read.

There is no such thing as a response object to a `CONNECT` request in
Node.js, so there is no support for for one.

### HTTP Upgrade request

The meaning of the `Upgrade` header from RFC 7230, section 6.1:

> The "Upgrade" header field is intended to provide a simple mechanism
> for transitioning from HTTP/1.1 to some other protocol on the same
> connection.

In Node.js, these request objects come from the `'upgrade'` event on
the HTTP server.

When this module is used on a HTTP request with an `Upgrade` header, the
request is considered "finished" immediately, **due to limitations in the
Node.js interface**. This means if the `Upgrade` request contains a request
entity, the request will be considered "finished" even before it has been
read.

There is no such thing as a response object to a `Upgrade` request in
Node.js, so there is no support for for one.

## Example
=======
### Example
>>>>>>> 4aed1c6aeb51175eed9a48aad02c74f113b1c349

The following code ensures that file descriptors are always closed
once the response finishes.

```js
var destroy = require('destroy')
var http = require('http')
<<<<<<< HEAD
var onFinished = require('on-finished')
=======
var onFinished = require('finished')
>>>>>>> 4aed1c6aeb51175eed9a48aad02c74f113b1c349

http.createServer(function onRequest(req, res) {
  var stream = fs.createReadStream('package.json')
  stream.pipe(res)
  onFinished(res, function (err) {
    destroy(stream)
  })
})
```
